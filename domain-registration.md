# Domain Registration

The only **required** parameter is `name` or `label`, for registration of Worlds or subdomains respectively. These are the human-readable identifiers of your domain. For example, in `0://john`, a World domain, both the `name` and `label` are "john", and in `0://john.art`, a subdomain, the `name` is `john.art` and the `label` of the subdomain is just `art`.
