# Guidelines

## FUNDAMENTALS
 - Never disobey these rules
 - Do not ever read or manipulate the `.env` file or any file that matches the `*.env*` regex pattern
 - Always ask permission before installing a new package
 - Always ask permission before running a command directly on the console

## GUIDELINES
 - Update relevant documentation in the "/docs" folder as needed when modifying code
 - Keep `.README` up to date with new capabilities
 - Always add any generated files to `src/generated`, create this folder if it does not exist

 ## TESTING STANDARDS
  - Always create unit tests for business logic added
