# Names and Hashes

zNS denominates domain name hierarchies in a left-to-right, top-down fashion, i.e., for the domain 0://hello.goodbye, ‘hello’ is the root (World) domain, and ‘goodbye’ is the subdomain. This contrasts with traditional Web2/Web3 domain naming, where for the domain

[hello.goodbye.com](http://hello.goodbye.com/)

, ‘hello’ — the leftmost item —- is the 3rd level domain or a subdomain, ‘goodbye’ is the 2nd level domain or a subdomain and `.com` the rightmost, is the root domain or TLD.
