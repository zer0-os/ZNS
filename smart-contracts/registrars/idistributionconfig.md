# IDistributionConfig

**IDistributionConfig.sol - An interface containing all types required for distribution configuration of a domain.**

Types outlined in this config are stored on the `ZNSSubRegistrar` contract and are used to determine how subdomains are distributed for each parent domain. Below are docs for the types in this file:

* `DistributionConfig`: Struct containing the configuration data for a parent domain:
  * `pricerContract`: The address of the pricer contract chosen by the owner of the parent domain (IZNSPricer type required!)
  * `paymentType`: The payment type chosen by the owner of the parent domain
  * `accessType`: The access type chosen by the owner of the parent domain
* `AccessType`: Enum signifying the access type of a parent domain:
  * `LOCKED`: The parent domain is locked which mean no subdomains can be registered
  * `OPEN`: The parent domain is open which means anyone can register a subdomain
  * `MINTLIST`: The parent domain has to approve each individual address for registering a subdomain
* `PaymentType`: Enum signifying the payment type for a parent domain:
  * `DIRECT`: The subdomains are paid for directly by the user to the beneficiary chosen by the owner
  * `STAKE`: The subdomains are paid for by staking an amount of token chosen by the owner to ZNSTreasury
