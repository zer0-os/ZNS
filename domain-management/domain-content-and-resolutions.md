# Domain Content and Resolutions

Domain's specify a resolver in as part of their configuration in the domain record. This resolve is a module that allows mapping from your domain name to a piece of data. This could be mapped to a wallet address, GitHub account, Twitter ID and so on. Doing so would allow other users or apps to call to `resolveDomainAddress` on your domain name and retrieve the resolved information.
