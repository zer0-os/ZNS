## ZNSAccessController

**The main module for system-wide Access Control.**

ZNS Business Logic Contract access to this module is outlined in `AAccessControlled.sol`.
Uses a role-based access control scheme with levels:
- GOVERNOR: The highest rank, assigns Admins, new roles and Role Admins
- ADMIN: The main maintainer role, that gets access to all system functions (managed by Governor)
- EXECUTOR: Can be here to future proof, if we need a new role (managed by Governor)
- REGISTRAR: This role is here specifically for the ZNSRootRegistrar.sol contract (managed by Admin)

> This contract is not proxied. When new implementation is needed, a new contract will be deployed
and all modules will be updated to use the new address, since they all inherit from `AAccessControlled.sol`.
