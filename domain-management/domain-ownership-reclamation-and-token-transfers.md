# Domain Ownership, Reclamation, and Token Transfers

This is done to support smart contract systems on top of zNS domains. Owners of worlds or subdomains may want to implement their own smart contracts that manage distribution or anything else, in order to do that they have to be owners or operators of a given domain, without the potential problem for a human user to lose their ownership or to not add contract code to transfer the token back to the original wallet which owner used to by this domain if contract is not needed. In this case, owner can split his ownership by setting a domain owner in ZNSRegistry to his contract, while keeping his NFT Domain Token on his wallet. When the contract does not need to be the owner anymore, a user that is holding the token can call `reclaimDomain` to automatically switch the owner from the contract back to his wallet that holds the NFT.
